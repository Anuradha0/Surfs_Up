# Surfs Up Overview of the analysis:
W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

**Results:**
1) The mean temperature of 75 F for June is higher than the mean temperature of 71 F for December.

2) Grouping the data into 15 bins, the histograms visually show how the frequency centers around the two different means. Using the same range for the temperatures, June appears to have a slight left skew, where December is more symmetrical

June:

3) However the minimum temp on both the months has major difference of 8 F june has 64 F and Dec has 56 F

**Summary:** 
Looking at the data and analysis, I would suggest to definetly open up a surf shop in Oahu as there isn't much difference in temp. So surfing can be all years sustainable idea for watersports and having said that ce cream shop business will also be a good idea.
